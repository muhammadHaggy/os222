# Week 1

1. [AWK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ02kEETw70) <br>
This video teaches you the basic of AWK. The video is short and give you the foundation to use AWK in Unix systems. AWK is really good at processing text files, comma separated values, and text databases.

2. [Vim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-txKSRn0qeA) <br>
Although the guy in the video is using VS Code to demonstrate Vim, it is still a good quick introduction to Vim. After this, you should be comfortable using, and of course exiting vim.

3. [Bash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4EWvMFj37g) <br>
Pretty good quick intro for using Bash. I found it very useful because I use Mac which is Unix based and came with Bash shell.

4. [Linux Shell Commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVquJh3DXUA) <br>
I think this a great beginner's tutorial on Linux commands. Simple and straight to the point. He also explains what will work and what will not work in using command functions and why.
